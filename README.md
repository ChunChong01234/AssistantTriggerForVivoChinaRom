## Overview

This app provides an easy way to trigger the Gemini assistant overlay using the Vivo sidebar, offering a smoother alternative to default gestures (especially for one-handed use).

Recently, I bought a Vivo X200 Pro (China ROM) and wanted a more convenient way to launch the Gemini assistant. After a week of research, I found that while there are various ways to trigger Geminisuch as gestures or physical buttons—many either don’t work well or require a purchase from the Play Store.

I discovered MiCTS, and with Vivo’s sidebar feature, it worked incredibly well—even better than the default gesture of holding the navigation bar. Inspired by this, I created a simple app to trigger the Gemini overlay through the sidebar for a more elegant, one-handed experience.

## How to Set Up

1. **Ensure Gemini Works on Your Device**

   If you see this UI when you launch Gemini, everything is set up correctly, proceed to download the app. Else, proceed to next step. 

2. **Set Google as the Default Assistant**

   If Gemini doesn’t launch, first set Google as your default assistant:

3. **Switch to Gemini**

   Then, switch the default assistant to Gemini:

4. **Install and Add the App to Sidebar**

   Finally, install this app and add it to your Vivo sidebar. You should now be able to trigger Gemini easily.
